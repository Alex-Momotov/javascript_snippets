    <meta name="description" content="This is a description that is used with search engines.">
                                    It is good to provide desctiption of the website so that search engines can find it.
                                    As a general rule the content of the description tag should not exeed 160 characters

    <meta name="author" content="Alex Momotov">
                                    This meta tag tells who the author of the HTML page is.

    <meta name="keywords" content="tutorial, learning, programming">
                                    Defines keywords that search engines can use to find your website.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                                    Ensures that website scales to the device width and then sets the iniial scale to 1.
                                    This is an important tag to include if we want to ensure the website will display
                                    well on mobile devices and devices with smaller screens.
