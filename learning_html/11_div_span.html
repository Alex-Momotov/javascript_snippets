<!--
It is a good practice to enclose all HTML code into "wrapper" tags that act as containers for everything else. The
reason for this is that later it will be more convenient to apply CSS to a particular container tag only.

There are two kinds of HTML containers - block elements and inline elements. Block elements take up the entire width of
the page. Inline elements take up only as much space as they need. So you could have inline elements sitting next to
each other on a page (side-to-side), but you could not have two block elements sitting in this way.

For example an anchor tag <a></a> is an inline element - two such tags defined on separate lines in HTML could be
displayed on the same line in the browser.

On the other hand, a paragraph tag <p></p> is an example of a block element. It takes up the entire width of the page.

<span></span>   Spans are inline container elements and can sit side-to-side on a page.
<div></div>     Divs are block container elements and take up the entire width of a page.
