<!--
<table></table>     Surrounding tags that signify beginning/end of a table in HTML.
<thead></thead>     Table head. Does not add any functionality and is not strictly necessary. Used to hold table
                    caption and column headings.
<tbody></tbody>     Table body. Does not add any functionality and is not strictly necessary. Used to hold table
                    rows and columns. Its nice to separate table head and body to make HTML code read easier.
<caption></caption> Functions as a title above the table. It is common to enclose text inside in a <h3> or similar.
<tr></tr>           Defines table row and holds individuals table column tags.
<td></td>           Defines table data and holds a single column entry. Has optional parameter colspan="n" where n
                    determines how many columns (to the right) that table entry will take up. Table rows are flexible
                    and if one row is longer than all others (more columns) it will simply stick out.
<th></th>           Defines title for a single column.
