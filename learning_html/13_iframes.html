<!--
<iframe></iframe>   Tags that allow us to embed a part of anoter website into our own.
                    They act as a "window" into another web page.

                    src specifies source of website we want to embed.

                    Text between opening and closing iframe tags specifies fallback text which is displayed if the
                    users browser does not support the website we are trying to iframe into.

                    frameborder="0" parameter gets rid of the grey border surrounding the embedded website.


A lot of the websites will not allow to iframe their page for security reasons. Someone could iframe PayPal while
taking the user data in a malicious way.
