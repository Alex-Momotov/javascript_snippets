Best practice is to put JavaScript code in the end of the <body></body> section. This is because it might take some time
to load and we don't want the user to wait for JavaScript to load.

//                                      Denotes a comment in JavaScript


<script></script>                       All JavaScript code lives between the script tags.


<script src="test.js"></script>         We can separate JavaScript code from our HTML code by putting the JS
                                        code into a file with .js extension and referencing it in our HTML code. To make
                                        reference to the .js file put the file's name as the src parameter in the
                                        <script> tag in the HTML page.


console.log('Hello, world!');           Will print out a string to the JavaScript console. The console can be found in a
                                        browser by clicking "inspect" then clicking "console" tab. We can also execute
                                        JavaScript commands directly from the console in the browser.
